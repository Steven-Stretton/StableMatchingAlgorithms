# Stable Matching Algorithm Tool

A proof-of-concept tool that was developed as part of my final year project. This tool uses stable matching algorithms to match individuals together based on preference. This tool also incorporates some of my Psychology background by implementing personality optimisation between the pairs, aiming to pair each individual with someone who has a highly compatible personality to increase productivity and social satisfaction between the pairs. 

This tool was built to be used within educational and professional environments to pair compatible individuals together, based on [M.B.T.I type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator) compatibility.

- [Irving's SR Algorithm](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~pat/jchoco/roommates/papers/Comp_sdarticle.pdf)

## What I've Learned

This project taught me about stable matching problems, and a number of algorithms which have been developed to successfully match entities together in such a way which maintains 'stability'.
